## Redesigned terminal

Despite being one of the oldest interfaces in computing, the terminal remains one of the most powerful and efficient tools available to developers. Beneath its minimal, text-only surface lies the ability to control nearly every aspect of a system—far more precisely and quickly than most graphical interfaces allow. Whether you're navigating a file system, managing infrastructure, writing scripts, or deploying applications, the terminal offers unmatched speed, automation, and flexibility.

In an era of modern tools and flashy UIs, the terminal is quietly irreplaceable—and it's evolving too. Tools like Warp are reimagining what a terminal can be: intuitive, collaborative, and AI-enhanced, without sacrificing the raw power that makes it so indispensable. As a matter of fact, it acts more like an IDE than a terminal, and is loaded with useful features!

## Overview of features

- Command Blocks: Each command and its output are grouped together into a block, making it easier to read and manage.

- GUI-style Input Editor: Warp provides a rich command input UI, including multi-line editing, syntax highlighting, and autosuggestions. This also includes providing information on flags for commandlets

- Searchable Output: You can easily scroll and search through previous outputs.

- Workflows: Warp supports sharable command templates and workflows, great for onboarding or repetitive tasks. It acts like Visual Studio Code where `Ctrl + Shift + P` opens a Command Palette. It looks like this in Warp

  Under workflows, you can save commands that you frequently use - or the infrequent ones - that are still tedious to remember!

- Agentic Development Environment: Warp AI can help suggest commands or even fix common errors. Upon switching to the ADE, you can select the desired LLM to complete your automation tasks.

- Built-in Notebooks: You can organize commands and outputs in a way that feels similar to Jupyter Notebooks.
